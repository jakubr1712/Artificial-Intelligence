# Backpropagation Neural Network

This program demonstrates the implementation of the backpropagation algorithm in artificial neural networks. Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm used for training neural networks, especially useful in tasks involving classification, prediction, and pattern recognition. The main purpose of this program is to illustrate how neural networks can learn and adjust their weights to accurately predict or classify data based on input.
Backpropagation is a powerful tool in learning artificial neural networks, allowing efficient training of models for a variety of applications, from simple classification tasks to complex image recognition and natural language processing problems.
