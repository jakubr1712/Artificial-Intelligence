# Hopfield's network

The program demonstrates the combination of Hopfield networks with binary pattern recognition and allows the use of various inputs. Possible applications include noise elimination, image reconstruction, and memory pattern sharing/retrieval. The Hopfield network is one of the types of artificial neural networks. The Hopfield network is mainly used for storing and retrieving memory patterns and eliminating noise.
